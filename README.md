# AR BASED NAVIGATION WITH EMERGENCY INFORMATION SYSTEM

In our pursuit of elevating navigation to new heights, we envision an AR Navigation system that embraces innovative possibilities, myriad of features to enhance the traveler's journey. 

Our vision includes travel planning assistance with AI virtual travel planner allowing users to create personalized itineraries. 
The standout feature lies in its robust emergency information system, which harnesses GPS technology to swiftly respond to accidents. The app automatically dispatches the individual's precise location to the contacts which are near to their location and emergency services, like ambulance. Remarkably, this functionality remains active even when the application is not actively in use, ensuring immediate and life-saving assistance when it matters most. 


## Features

### Emergency Assistance:
Hackvisionaries offers 24/7 emergency assistance functionality.Users can quickly send their current location to preconfigured helplines or emergency services during critical situations such as accidents or when feeling threatened.

### Augmented Reality Navigation: 
The app utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to provide real-time navigation guidance, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Bot Assistance: 
An intelligent bot is integrated to provide real-time assistance with voice assistance, offering personalized route recommendations based on safety, health, and cost-effectiveness. Dynamic route recommendations adapt to real-time conditions, including avoiding high-traffic areas, minimizing pollution exposure, and optimizing travel costs.
